## Using Docker Compose

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure the following are installed and available on your system:

* **Docker** or **Docker Desktop -**  (Docker Version - 20.10.x and above)
* Open ports: **8080**, **8081**, **3000**, **5432 -** Ensure that the following ports are not in use:

### 1.1 Setup with Docker Compose

1. Navigate to the project folder in your terminal.
2. Run the following command to start the Docker containers:

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

   This command will pull and download the necessary containers, and the client will run on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
3. Default Credentials for client app - **Username**: dev@breezeware.net **Password**: breeze123 or Signup.
4. Application Port
   * **Backend Server** - 8081
   * **Frontend Client -** 3000
   * **Auth Server -** 8080

### 1.2 If Docker not installed - Docker Installation

#### **For Docker on Linux:**

1. Update your packages:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   ```
2. Install Docker using:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install docker.io
   ```
3. Verify installation:

   ```bash
   docker --version
   ```

#### **For Docker Desktop on Mac/Windows:**

1. Download and install Docker Desktop from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
2. Follow the installation instructions and start Docker Desktop.

### 1.3 Troubleshooting

#### Checking and Managing Active Ports

Ensure that the following ports are not in use:

* **8080**
* **8081**
* **3000**
* **5432**

If any of these ports are active, you need to free them by killing the respective processes. You can check for active ports using:

```bash
lsof -i :<port_number>
```

To kill a process on a specific port:

```bash
kill -9 <process_id>
```

#### If you encounter file permission issues, use the following command:

```bash
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER postgres-data/
```

#### If this doesnâ€™t resolve the issue, try:

* Resetting changes with Git:

  ```bash
  git checkout .
  ```
* Deleting the project and re-cloning it.

#### If you encounter Error response from daemon: pull access denied for public.ecr.aws, use the following command:

```bash
docker logout public.ecr.aws
```

## Additional Notes

* Always verify that no other processes are using ports **8080**, **8081**, **3000**, or **5432** before running the services.
* If you encounter issues with ports, repeat the process to kill active ports as mentioned above.
